## FAQ
**Can you add [species]?**  
This pack is still in beta, so it doesn't have every species yet, but I'm adding new ones every update. Check out the [project roadmap](https://github.com/users/Kraggle09/projects/2) to see if your prefered species is planned yet. If it isn't, feel free to open a feature request for it.

**What's the difference between the Lite and Full versions?**  
The Lite version has all the species that actually give unique benefits. The Full version has all the species, including the ones with no unique benefits. Both versions will always be free, forever.

The latest version of Java edition. (although it may work for older versions)
