This pack is still in beta, so it doesn't have every species yet, but I'm adding new ones every update. Check out the [project roadmap](https://github.com/users/Kraggle09/projects/2) to see if your prefered species is planned yet. If it isn't, feel free to open a feature request for it.

The latest version of Java edition. (although it may work for older versions)

Ports are not planned at this time.
