## FAQ
**Can you add [species]?**  
I have added most of the species I have planned, but I'm open to suggestions. Check out the [project roadmap](https://github.com/users/Kraggle09/projects/4) to see if your preferred species is planned yet. If it isn't, feel free to open a feature request for it, and I'll try to add it.

**Why do some older versions mention a Lite version?**  
The lite version was a smaller version of the pack which removed several useless species. Now, that's not neccessary, since the species in the pack have more features, and the menu makes species selection easier.  

**What version of Minecraft is this for?**  
The latest version of Java edition. (although it may work for older versions)  

**Can you port this to Bedrock/Older version of Java?**  
Ports are not planned at this time. For more information, see [this page](https://github.com/Kraggle09/dnd-datapack/wiki/Ports).

**Can I use this in a YouTube video?**  
Absolutely, just please provide a link in the description to this page.  

**What edition of DnD is this based off of?**  
Fifth Edition
