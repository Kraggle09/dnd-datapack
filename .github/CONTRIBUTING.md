# Contributing guidelines

## Issues (bugs and feature requests)
1.  Check to see if this issue has already been reported on this page
    *   If so, please don’t report it again. Instead, comment any further notes/ideas you have regarding the issue.
2.  If it hasn’t been requested, then you can open a new issue
3.  Select the correct template for your issue
4.  Add information, following the guidelines described in the template
5.  Submit the issue, and **be patient**. Some features take time to add, and I can’t guarantee that I’ll have the knowledge necessary to implement it.

## Contributing Code
1.  Think about what exactly you are trying to accomplish with this contribution. Try to only add one feature per pull request. 
2.  Fork this repository
3.  Edit the code to add the feature
    *   It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the codebase before modifying it. This way your code will work well, and will fit the general style of my code.
4.  Test the code in-game! Make sure it actually works before submitting.
5.  Open a pull request, and describe what this feature does and any major things it modifies
6.  Give the pull request a good title, and add [Feature] (for new features), [Tweak] (for a small change), [Fix] (for a bug fix), or [Improvements] for general improvements that may fall under multiple categories.
8.  Wait for me to merge it (which I may or may not do, no guarantees), then either delete the fork or leave it for future use.
